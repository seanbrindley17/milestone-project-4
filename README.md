For my final Code Institute project, I was tasked with create a full stack website in Django. The parameters were that it had to use Django to create multiple 'apps', had to involve CRUD functionality, Stripe functionality and email functionality. The example project of Boutique Ado was a large influence in all aspects due to being my only reference point for a larger Django app like this.

I decided to do a theoretical redesign of my old swimming club's shop, fitting the theme of my last project with swimming and also because I own a good amount of kit so instead of getting photos from the internet I just took my own. My Modus Operandi for these past two projects has been minimal styling and more a focus on the backend stuff because ultimately that's where my interest lies, I don't have much of a design brain. I would have liked to do a bit more customisation when compared to the Boutique Ado example but as there was just so much new stuff to try and cram in I didn't feel like it was too feasible to attempt to deviate too much. I did however use Django 5 in my project, which caused some issues trying to follow along but these were eventually solved.

## UX

### The 5 Planes of UX

#### 1. Strategy Plane
##### Purpose
- Provide a seamless and intuitive e-commerce experience for customers to browse, filter, and purchase products.
- Empower site owners to manage the store's inventory and customer orders efficiently.

##### Primary User Needs
- Guest users need to browse products and checkout with ease.
- Registered customers need a streamlined shopping experience with account and order history features.
- Site owners need robust tools for inventory and order management.

##### Business Goals
- Drive sales by providing a user-friendly shopping experience.
- Build customer loyalty through personalized and efficient account features.
- Maintain an organized and up-to-date store inventory.

#### 2. Scope Plane
##### Features
- A full list of [Features](#features) can be viewed in detail below.

##### Content Requirements
- Product details, including name, price, description, category, and images.
- Clear prompts and instructions for browsing, filtering, and purchasing.
- Order details, confirmation pages, and email notifications.
- Secure payment processing using Stripe.
- Payment success emails sent to users.
- 404 page for lost users.

#### 3. Structure Plane
##### Information Architecture
- **Navigation Menu**:
  - Links to Home, Products, Cart, Newsletter, and Account sections.
- **Hierarchy**:
  - Prominent product categories and filters for easy navigation.
  - Cart and checkout options displayed prominently for convenience.

##### User Flow
1. Guest user browses the store → filters and sorts products by category, price, or name.
2. Guest user adds items to the cart → proceeds to checkout.
3. Guest user creates an account or logs in during checkout → completes purchase.
4. Returning customers log in → view past orders and track purchase history.
5. Site owners manage inventory → add, update, or delete products and categories.
6. Users signup to the newsletter → potentially receive advanced notice of upcoming sales.

#### 4. Skeleton Plane
##### Wireframe Suggestions
- A full list of [Wireframes](#wireframes) can be viewed in detail below.

#### 5. Surface Plane
##### Visual Design Elements
- **[Colours](#colour-scheme)**: see below.
- **[Typography](#typography)**: see below.

### Colour Scheme

I didn't use too much in the way of colour on my site.
The text was left mostly default black, except on links and buttons, where I used the bootstrap text-success, text-danger, text-info classes 

- `#7edeed` The background colour of the header and footer

### Typography

#### Font

- [Oxanium](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Oxanium) was used throughout the site purely because I like it.

#### Icons

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.

### Future Features

- **More Products**: Initially I had fins as a product, which would use a different sizing format to the regular. Unfortunately I ran out of time while trying to impliment it without breaking my code so I decided to forgo them and add them myself as a little project after the fact.
- **Better Sorting/Classification**: When adding more products I'd like ways to sort them better. i.e. if the shop were to sell things explicitly for females then I'd like a sort option for women's products for example.
- **Product Inventory Alerts**: Notify customers when out-of-stock items are back in stock, or when low inventory is approaching.
- **Multi-Currency and Multi-Language Support**: Expand the application to support multiple currencies and languages to reach a global audience.

## Database Design

### Data Model

Here's an ERD for my database.

![screenshot](/readme-documentation/ERD/mermaid-diagram-2025-02-04-165450.png)

I have used `Mermaid` to generate an interactive ERD of my project.

## Testing

> [!NOTE]
> For all testing, please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.

## Deployment

The live deployed application can be found deployed on [Heroku](https://milestone-project-4-sb-1448d349aa27.herokuapp.com).

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), then finally, click **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set your environment variables to match your private `env.py` file.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a sample only; you would replace the values with your own if cloning/forking my repository.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | user-inserts-own-aws-access-key-id |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | user-inserts-own-aws-secret-access-key |
| `DATABASE_URL` | user-inserts-own-postgres-database-url |
| `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` | 1 (*this is temporary, and can be removed for the final deployment*) |
| `EMAIL_HOST_PASS` | user-inserts-own-gmail-api-key |
| `EMAIL_HOST_USER` | user-inserts-own-gmail-email-address |
| `SECRET_KEY` | any-random-secret-key |
| `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` | user-inserts-own-stripe-public-key |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | user-inserts-own-stripe-secret-key |
| `STRIPE_WH_SECRET` | user-inserts-own-stripe-webhook-secret |
| `USE_AWS` | True |

Heroku needs some additional files in order to deploy properly.

- [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)
- [Procfile](Procfile)

You can install this project's **[requirements.txt](requirements.txt)** (*where applicable*) using:

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:

- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **[Procfile](Procfile)** can be created with the following command:

- `echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile`
- *replace `app_name` with the name of your primary Django app name; the folder where `settings.py` is located*

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either (*recommended*):

- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:

- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (*replace `app_name` with your app name*)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
	- `git push heroku main`

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### PostgreSQL

This project uses a [Code Institute PostgreSQL Database](https://dbs.ci-dbs.net) for the Relational Database with Django.

> [!CAUTION]
> - PostgreSQL databases by Code Institute are only available to CI Students.
> - You must acquire your own PostgreSQL database through some other method if you plan to clone/fork this repository.
> - Code Institute students are allowed a maximum of 8 databases.
> - Databases are subject to deletion after 18 months.

To obtain my own Postgres Database from Code Institute, I followed these steps:

- Submitted my email address to the CI PostgreSQL Database link above.
- An email was sent to me with my new Postgres Database.
- The Database connection string will resemble something like this:
    - `postgres://<db_username>:<db_password>@<db_host_url>/<db_name>`
- You can use the above URL with Django; simply paste it into your `env.py` file and Heroku Config Vars as `DATABASE_URL`.

### Amazon AWS

This project uses [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) to store media and static files online, due to the fact that Heroku doesn't persist this type of data.

Once you've created an AWS account and logged-in, follow these series of steps to get your project connected. Make sure you're on the **AWS Management Console** page.

#### S3 Bucket

- Search for **S3**.
- Create a new bucket, give it a name (e.g. matching your Heroku app name), and choose the region closest to you.
- Uncheck **Block all public access**, and acknowledge that the bucket will be public (*required* for it to work on Heroku).
- From **Object Ownership**, make sure to have **ACLs enabled**, and **Bucket owner preferred** selected.
- From the **Properties** tab, turn on static website hosting, and type `index.html` and `error.html` in their respective fields, then click **Save**.
- From the **Permissions** tab, paste in the following CORS configuration:

	```shell
	[
		{
			"AllowedHeaders": [
				"Authorization"
			],
			"AllowedMethods": [
				"GET"
			],
			"AllowedOrigins": [
				"*"
			],
			"ExposeHeaders": []
		}
	]
	```

- Copy your **ARN** string.
- From the **Bucket Policy** tab, select the **Policy Generator** link, and use the following steps:
	- Policy Type: **S3 Bucket Policy**
	- Effect: **Allow**
	- Principal: `*`
	- Actions: **GetObject**
	- Amazon Resource Name (ARN): **paste-your-ARN-here**
	- Click **Add Statement**
	- Click **Generate Policy**
	- Copy the entire Policy, and paste it into the **Bucket Policy Editor**

		```shell
		{
			"Id": "Policy1234567890",
			"Version": "2012-10-17",
			"Statement": [
				{
					"Sid": "Stmt1234567890",
					"Action": [
						"s3:GetObject"
					],
					"Effect": "Allow",
					"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
					"Principal": "*",
				}
			]
		}
		```

	- Before you click "Save", add `/*` to the end of the Resource key in the Bucket Policy Editor (*like above*).
	- Click **Save**.
- From the **Access Control List (ACL)** section, click "Edit" and enable **List** for **Everyone (public access)**, and accept the warning box.
	- If the edit button is disabled, you need to change the **Object Ownership** section above to **ACLs enabled** (*mentioned above*).

#### IAM

Back on the AWS Services Menu, search for and open **IAM** (Identity and Access Management). Once on the IAM page, follow these steps:

- From **User Groups**, click **Create New Group**.
	- Suggested Name: `group-milestone-project-4` (*group + the project name*)
- Tags are optional, but you must click it to get to the **review policy** page.
- From **User Groups**, select your newly created group, and go to the **Permissions** tab.
- Open the **Add Permissions** dropdown, and click **Attach Policies**.
- Select the policy, then click **Add Permissions** at the bottom when finished.
- From the **JSON** tab, select the **Import Managed Policy** link.
	- Search for **S3**, select the `AmazonS3FullAccess` policy, and then **Import**.
	- You'll need your ARN from the S3 Bucket copied again, which is pasted into "Resources" key on the Policy.

		```shell
		{
			"Version": "2012-10-17",
			"Statement": [
				{
					"Effect": "Allow",

	- Click **Review Policy**.
	- Suggested Name: `policy-milestone-project-4` (*policy + the project name*)
	- Provide a description:
		- "Access to S3 Bucket for milestone-project-4 static files."
	- Click **Create Policy**.
- From **User Groups**, click your "group-milestone-project-4".
- Click **Attach Policy**.
- Search for the policy you've just created ("policy-milestone-project-4") and select it, then **Attach Policy**.
- From **User Groups**, click **Add User**.
	- Suggested Name: `user-milestone-project-4` (*user + the project name*)
- For "Select AWS Access Type", select **Programmatic Access**.
- Select the group to add your new user to: `group-milestone-project-4`
- Tags are optional, but you must click it to get to the **review user** page.
- Click **Create User** once done.
- You should see a button to **Download .csv**, so click it to save a copy on your system.
	- **IMPORTANT**: once you pass this page, you cannot come back to download it again, so do it immediately!
	- This contains the user's **Access key ID** and **Secret access key**.
	- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` = **Access key ID**
	- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` = **Secret access key**

#### Final AWS Setup

- If Heroku Config Vars has `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` still, this can be removed now, so that AWS will handle the static files.
- Back within **S3**, create a new folder called: `media`.
- Select any existing media images for your project to prepare them for being uploaded into the new folder.
- Under **Manage Public Permissions**, select **Grant public read access to this object(s)**.
- No further settings are required, so click **Upload**.

### Stripe API

This project uses [Stripe](https://stripe.com) to handle the ecommerce payments.

Once you've created a Stripe account and logged-in, follow these series of steps to get your project connected.

- From your Stripe dashboard, click to expand the "Get your test API keys".
- You'll have two keys here:
	- `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` = Publishable Key (starts with **pk**)
	- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` = Secret Key (starts with **sk**)

As a backup, in case users prematurely close the purchase-order page during payment, we can include Stripe Webhooks.

- From your Stripe dashboard, click **Developers**, and select **Webhooks**.
- From there, click **Add Endpoint**.
	- `https://milestone-project-4-sb-1448d349aa27.herokuapp.com/checkout/wh/`
- Click **receive all events**.
- Click **Add Endpoint** to complete the process.
- You'll have a new key here:
	- `STRIPE_WH_SECRET` = Signing Secret (Wehbook) Key (starts with **wh**)

### Gmail API

This project uses [Gmail](https://mail.google.com) to handle sending emails to users for purchase order confirmations.

Once you've created a Gmail (Google) account and logged-in, follow these series of steps to get your project connected.

- Click on the **Account Settings** (cog icon) in the top-right corner of Gmail.
- Click on the **Accounts and Import** tab.
- Within the section called "Change account settings", click on the link for **Other Google Account settings**.
- From this new page, select **Security** on the left.
- Select **2-Step Verification** to turn it on. (*verify your password and account*)
- Once verified, select **Turn On** for 2FA.
- Navigate back to the **Security** page, and you'll see a new option called **App passwords** (*search for it at the top, if not*).
- This might prompt you once again to confirm your password and account.
- Select **Mail** for the app type.
- Select **Other (Custom name)** for the device type.
    - Any custom name, such as "Django" or `milestone-project-4`
- You'll be provided with a 16-character password (API key).
    - Save this somewhere locally, as you cannot access this key again later!
    - If your 16-character password contains *spaces*, make sure to remove them entirely.
    - `EMAIL_HOST_PASS` = user's 16-character API key
    - `EMAIL_HOST_USER` = user's own personal Gmail email address


### Local Development

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file.

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

You will need to create a new file called `env.py` at the root-level, and include the same environment variables listed above from the Heroku deployment steps.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a sample only; you would replace the values with your own if cloning/forking my repository.

Sample `env.py` file:

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID", "user-inserts-own-aws-access-key-id")
os.environ.setdefault("AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY", "user-inserts-own-aws-secret-access-key")
os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "user-inserts-own-postgres-database-url")
os.environ.setdefault("EMAIL_HOST_PASS", "user-inserts-own-gmail-host-api-key")
os.environ.setdefault("EMAIL_HOST_USER", "user-inserts-own-gmail-email-address")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "any-random-secret-key")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY", "user-inserts-own-stripe-public-key")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_SECRET_KEY", "user-inserts-own-stripe-secret-key")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_WH_SECRET", "user-inserts-own-stripe-webhook-secret")  # only if using Stripe Webhooks

# local environment only (do not include these in production/deployment!)
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
os.environ.setdefault("DEVELOPMENT", "True")
```

Once the project is cloned or forked, in order to run it locally, you'll need to follow these steps:

- Start the Django app: `python3 manage.py runserver`
- Stop the app once it's loaded: `CTRL+C` (*Windows/Linux*) or `⌘+C` (*Mac*)
- Make any necessary migrations: `python3 manage.py makemigrations --dry-run` then `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
- Migrate the data to the database: `python3 manage.py migrate --plan` then `python3 manage.py migrate`
- Create a superuser: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
- Load fixtures (*if applicable*): `python3 manage.py loaddata file-name.json` (*repeat for each file*)
- Everything should be ready now, so run the Django app again: `python3 manage.py runserver`

If you'd like to backup your database models, use the following command for each model you'd like to create a fixture for:

- `python3 manage.py dumpdata your-model > your-model.json`
- *repeat this action for each model you wish to backup*
- **NOTE**: You should never make a backup of the default *admin* or *users* data with confidential information.

#### Cloning
